    Picking just 25 titles for this list of best anime was really difficult,
     but our team of experts eventually came up withthe top titles. We took 
     several things into consideration when choosingour 25: Did the anime
      leave its mark on the culture in a meaningful way?Did they influence 
      the industry and genre? And, of course, did we just like them?
      <br>
      <br>
      Anime differs from other forms of animation by its art styles, methods 
      of animation, its production, and its process. Visually, anime works 
      exhibit a wide variety of art styles, differing between creators, artists,
       and studios.[47] While no single art style predominates anime as a whole, 
      they do share some similar attributes in terms of animation technique and
       character design. Anime is fundamentally characterized by the use of limited
        animation, flat expression, the suspension of time, its thematic range,
         the presence of historical figures, its complex narrative line and, above
          all, a peculiar drawing style, with characters characterized by large and 
          oval eyes, with very defined lines, bright colors and reduced movement of the lips.</div>

      <h1>25. Haikyuu!!</h1><br>
      <a href="https://youtu.be/JOGp2c7-cKc" target="_blank">
      <img src="C:\Users\fuzzi\Downloads\haikyuu-1663869063445.jpeg" height="500px" width="1000px"></a>
     <p> There are not many sports anime that can knock it out of 
      the park in almost every way but Haikyuu!! manages to do that.
       The series revolves around a fairly large ensemble consisting 
       of a high school volleyball team. Even though that may seem like
        a hurdle, the character development is well balanced and you’ll 
        find yourself rooting for each member whether their role is big or 
        small. The animation from Production IG is top-notch as well, elevating
         the tension of each match and play to the point that you’ll be glued to
          the front of your screen all episode. Haikyuu!! succeeds in creating an amazing sports
       team formula that other similar series should strive for.

      <h1> 24. Trigun</h1><br>
      <a href="https://youtu.be/AzZYXqUdp5o" target="_blank">
              <img src="C:\Users\fuzzi\Downloads\trigun-1663869114240.jpg" height="500px" width="1000px"></a>
     <p> Trigun is a classic late 90s sci-fi space Western taking place on a desert planet 
      literally called, No Man's Land. The Protagonist, Vash the Stampede isn't your
       typical strong and stoic gunslinger.  Rather he's a quirky goofy guy in an
        awesome red duster coat with a hyperactive pacifist streak. The story 
        explores Vash's journey to uncover his amnesiac past, battle the mysterious 
        group hunting him, and discover why he has a 60 Billion Double Dollar bounty 
        on his head. What makes Trigun truly stand out are the unique stylistic
         character and weapon designs, as well as the twisting plot that you understand 
         more and more on every rewatch. The series returns in 
      Trigun Stampede in 2023.

      <h1>23. Dragon Ball Z</h1><br>

      <img src="C:\Users\fuzzi\Downloads\dragon-ball-z.webp" height="500px" width="1000px"></a>
     <p> Dragon Ball Z was a gateway drug for many a young anime fan, and for good reason. The 
        series isn't particularly deep, as it basically revolves around superhuman martial artist
         Goku and his friends testing their mettle against an increasingly powerful and outlandish 
         series of foes. But what the series lacks in terms of plot, it more than makes up for in 
         humor, kooky characters and incredible action. How can you not have fun with a martial
          arts fantasy where most of the characters are strong enough to shatter planets with their
           bare hands?

      <h1>22. My Hero Academia</h1><br>

     <p> Superhero stories are a dime a dozen, but My Hero Academia offers a unique twist on the familiar genre by focusing 
        on Izuku Midoriya, a hero who was born without powers (but is determined to save people regardless) in a world full 
        of folks with abilities. Even after he earns the "quirk" he's always dreamed of, MHA constantly finds ways to 
        challenge Midoriya's traditional hero's journey by offering new twists on well-worn tropes, exploring what it 
        means to be a hero with consistent humor and heart -- not to mention some spectacular action sequences. Between
         its stunning animation, loveable roster of well-developed supporting characters, and talent for coming up with 
         some of the most ridiculous and unique superpowers ever committed to the screen, My Hero Academia is a breath 
         of fresh air -- frequently silly, often sweet, and consistently surprising.

      <h1>21. Made in Abyss</h1><br>
      <a href="https://youtu.be/kqBNQEUI8dM">
      <img src="C:\Users\fuzzi\Downloads\madeinabyss-1663869946626.jpg" height="500px" width="1000px"></a>
     

    <p>  Made in Abyss is rare in that it’s a story that could barely be told in any medium besides manga or 
        anime, and takes full advantage of it to weave a fascinating, gut-wrenching story fueled by both despair
         and hope in equal measure. Riko and Reg live in a fascinating world with a deep, mysterious “abyss” at 
         the center of it all. Few return from the deeper levels alive, as ascending can cause effects much worse
         than a diver’s decompression sickness. Riko’s mother is assumed to be lost, but Riko and Reg set off to find her
          and uncover the mysteries of the abyss. The longer the story goes on, the more fantastical and depraved i
          t gets, much like the titular abyss itself. Everything from the impressive creature design, the mystery 
          of it, and the hopeful characters keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Though it looks cute and sweet on
           the outset, Made in Abyss deserves all the content warnings it gets, and is not for the faint of heart.
      
      Our Favorite Anime
      Now that we've picked what we consider to be deserving of this list, we also wanted to share our personal #1 
      top series. Here's the all-time favorite anime of IGN's staff:
     </p>
      <br>
      <h1>20. Jojo's Bizarre Adventure (Entire Series)</h1><br>
      <img src="C:\Users\fuzzi\Downloads\jojo-dio-brando-cosplay-1241185-1663870114182.jpg" height="500px" width="1000px">
    

     <p> Oh my god! This is a normal response from watching this weirdly amazing shounen anime that follows the different 
        generations of the Joestar family. The influential manga series has been around since 1987 and has only been airing
         the anime since 2012. It was tough to decide on which part of the long-running series was deserving of this spot 
         so we’re taking all of this bizarre series into account. JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure is full of amazing action, wild
          characters, and iconic moments that will live on through the anime community (and memes)

      <h1>19. Naruto Shippuden</h1><br>
      <img src="C:\Users\fuzzi\Downloads\naruto-shippuden-1574296571967-1663870225881.jpg" height="500px" width="1000px">
      <p>The long-running Naruto series has been referred to as one of the “big three” anime because of its wild popularity
         around the world, and for good reason. It’s full of action-packed fight sequences, hilariously fun moments,
          and dramatic scenes that pull at your heartstrings. In Naruto Shippuden, the story takes a darker and more serious 
          tone as the characters are now older and face even more daunting challenges from the shadows as well as themselves. 
          The Naruto anime series is known for its memorable characters and relationships, and it continues to be one of the
           biggest shounen anime ever, even long after it has ended.

      <h1>18. Death Note</h1><br>
      <img src="C:\Users\fuzzi\Downloads\deathnote-1663870021590.jpg" height="500px" width="1000px">
<p>

      Death Note is a now classic anime that follows Light Yagami, a teen who gains supernatural abilities via the Death 
      Note. A book that grants the user the ability to kill anyone they want, just by writing that person’s name in the book.
        With the power of the Death Note and a genius intellect, Light goes on a genocidal “moral” crusade that impacts 
        the world.  What ensues beyond is cat and mouse between World Class investigators who rival Light in cunning and 
        intellect. This show has gone on to inspire many other dark protagonist shonen anime as well as many live-action
         adaptations. Which rightfully earns its place as one of the best and most influential anime of all time.
    <br>  
    </p>
      <h1>17. Attack on Titan</h1><br>
      <img src="C:\Users\fuzzi\Downloads\attack-on-colossal-titan-1663870328553.jpg" height="500px" width="1000px">
<p>

      On that day, humanity was reminded of the fear they held for the titans. Attack on Titan became an instant 
      classic when it was first released in 2013. Following three friends, Eren Yeager, Mikasa Ackerman, and Armin
      Arlert, they fight alongside humanity's greatest soldiers against gargantuan Titans and the threats that lie 
      beyond their city walls. What started as a typical shonen anime evolved into an amazing piece of art tackling 
      themes of war, classism/racism, among other heavy topics. It’s hard to find anyone who has not felt the impact 
      of this show, with director Alex Garland even calling out the series as a source of inspiration. A mixture of 
      high-intensity action, slow character-driven scenes, and Game of Thrones-esque deaths that come out of nowhere 
      culminate into one of the greatest anime to emerge from the modern age.

      <h1>16. Ouran High School Host Club</h1><br>
      <img src="C:\Users\fuzzi\Downloads\ouran-high-school-host-club-1574296578793-1663870537662.jpg" height="500px" width="1000px">
     <p>

      It's hard to explain all the ways in which Ouran High School Host Club rules. If you're a fan of manga and anime, 
      you'll love the ways the story takes the conventions of the medium and turns them on its head at every turn. And if 
      you love a great story, you'll immediately be grabbed by Bisco Hatori's hilarious take on the shojo subgenre. 
      When Haruhi Fujioka happens to stumble upon her school's popular host club, where male students entertain female
      ones for money, she accidentally breaks an expensive vase and suddenly finds herself mistaken for a boy and forced 
      to become a host. Her awkward nature and shyness mean that it's an uncomfortable setup, but as she finds her place 
      in the Host Club she also begins to find herself, her courage, and a whole new group of friends. Ouran High School
       Host Club is a sweet and silly satire on the idea of otaku culture, and it's also one of the trailblazers in fujoshi comedy.

      <h1>15. Devilman Crybaby</h1><br>
      <img src="C:\Users\fuzzi\Downloads\devilman-crybaby.webp" height="500px" width="1000px">
  
<p>
      Unlike most of Netflix's original programming, Devilman Crybaby offers a succinct and moving story in the span 
      of 10 episodes. But be warned, Devilman Crybaby is sure to make younger viewers with parents in the room extremely
       uncomfortable with its explicit depictions of sex, violence, and profanity. But in its exploration of what some may 
       deem filth, Devilman Crybaby finds humanity. This loose interpretation of the biblical apocalypse -- Devilman Crybaby
        is a profoundly modern take on the Book of Revelation -- is a study of love, sacrifice, and God's love (or disdain) 
        for humanity. The modern lens helps the biblical punches find their way into contemporary guts. And thanks to the 
        gorgeous style, bangin' Japanese hip hop, and a cast of memorable characters, you don't really mind the pain.
      
      Watch Devilman Crybaby on Netflix.
    <br></p>
      <h1>14. Demon Slayer</h1><br>
      <img src="C:\Users\fuzzi\Downloads\demonslayer-1663870772245.jpg" height="500px" width="1000px">
<p>
      The record-breaking Demon Slayer has blown up tremendously in the last few years and it’s not too surprising to those
       that have followed the series up until now. Every single episode of Demon Slayer is consistently impressive with 
       smooth animation that never compromises its gorgeous art, incredible visual effects that bring the spectacular 
       battles to life, and an amazing soundtrack that punctuates its many emotional high points. Not only that, Demon Slayer
        will make you laugh out loud thanks to the over-the-top absurdity of characters like Zentisu and Inosuke, and 
        it’ll just as easily make you tear up with its heavy themes of loss and family.
      
      Honorable Mentions
      After deliberations, these titles didn’t quite make the final cut. These are the titles we would've included if

      <h1>13. Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion</h1><br>
      <img src="C:\Users\fuzzi\Downloads\codegeass-1663870838704.jpg" height="500px" width="1000px">
    <p>

      This show, originally released in 2006, has stood the test of time thanks to its two most alluring elements: a captivating 
      setting comprised of meticulous worldbuilding, and a narrative that builds through strategy and shattering twists, like that
       of a thriller. The story takes place in an alternate timeline, very much reminiscent of Nineteen Eighty-Four, where the 
       world consists of three superpowers: the Holy Britannian Empire, the Chinese Federation, and the European Union. Before 
       the commencement of the story proper, the Holy Britannian Empire has conquered Japan, stripping the country of its name 
       and freedom, with the use of enormous mechs. So, yes, this is a heavily political mecha thriller of an anime with some 
       thrilling action scenes that carry the excitement ever forward. Our protagonist, Lelouch, is an exiled Britannian prince 
       now living in Japan who swears to bring down his father’s empire. The show, with political subterfuge, enticing mythology,
        and fascinating characters, has gone down as one of the great mecha anime of all time.

      <h1>12. Samurai Champloo</h1><br>

<p>

      After Cowboy Bebop, Shinichiro Watanabe’s stock was at an all-time high, and his follow up, a simple Samurai story with
       a touch of hip hop, served only to cement his legacy as one of the greats in anime directing. Samurai Champloo, like
        Cowboy Bebop before it, was mostly episodic, and while its overarching story isn’t anything to write home about, the
         individual arcs of each of its three main characters were engrossing to follow, with equal amounts of emotionally
          resonant story beats and literal off the wall action.

<p>
      In just 16 episodes, Baccano packs more story and intrigue than most anime are able to in twice or even three times that 
      amount. It’s a fast-paced thrill ride, not unlike the unforgettable train ride that serves as the centerpiece of its twisty 
      story, and it features some of the most memorable psychopaths you’ll find in anime. Baccano unfolds like a puzzle, with 
      almost every episode providing you with a new revelation that totally flips the way you’ve viewed things thus far. And even 
      beyond all of that, it also has one of the best dubs you’ll ever hear.

     <h1> 10. FLCL</h1><br>
      <img src="C:\Users\fuzzi\Downloads\flcl.webp" height="500px" width="1000px">
    
      <p>FLCL (pronounced Fooly Cooly) is short even by normal anime standards, but there’s a lot to be said for a good sci-fi
         comedy that knows how to call it a day before wearing out its welcome. FLCL is about as bizarre and hilarious as anime
          gets, with the original series revolving around an ordinary suburban boy named Naota Nandaba and his new “friend,” a 
          quirky alien woman named Haruko Haruhara. The very first episode features Naota growing giant robots from his head, 
          and the series only gets wackier from there. The surreal tone, the incredible soundtrack and the experimental animation 
          style all serve to make FLCL a wholly unique and unforgettable anime experience.

      <h1>9. Yu Yu Hakusho</h1><br>
      <img src="C:\Users\fuzzi\Downloads\yu-yu-hakusho.webp" height="500px" width="1000px">
    <p>

      We follow Yusuke Urameshi, a 14-year-old teenage delinquent who is hit by a car and dies saving a child. Yusuke finds out
       that he has no place in heaven or hell, but he's offered a second chance at life when he's charged with investigating 
       supernatural activity in the Human World and given the title of Spirit World Detective. With the help of his friends 
       and a unique technique called Spirit, Gun that allows him to shoot a Kamehameha from his finger, Yusuke strives to protect
        the balance between the Human and Demon Worlds. This series stands shoulder to shoulder with Dragon Ball Z as one of the
         most influential action anime of the ’90s.

      <img src="C:\Users\fuzzi\Downloads\neon-genesis-evangelion.webp" height="500px" width="1000px">
    

      <p>There’s a reason we all still need an ending explained for Neon Genesis Evangelion more than 20 years after its
        release. The mythology behind the production of Hideaki Anno’s groundbreaking anime has become as much a part of
         Evangelion’s story as the anime itself, with its final two episodes still being divisive and up for debate. There’s 
         no debate over Evangelion’s continued excellence, though, both as an elevated take on the mech anime genre and as a
          harrowing and incredibly personal exploration of depression. Even with countless movie and series sequels and
           reimaginings, nothing touches the masterwork of Neon Genesis Evangelion’s first run, which remains a fan-favorite
            and showcases how a singular auteur approach to storytelling can create art that continues to resonate for generations.

      <h1>7. Hunter x Hunter</h1><br>
      <img src="C:\Users\fuzzi\Downloads\hunter-x-hunter.webp" height="500px" width="1000px">
  
<p>
      Hunter x Hunter (pronounced Hunter Hunter) starts out with a familiar trope: A hero, in this case a young boy named Gon,
       leaves his small town for the first time on an adventure. He leaves the island on a quest to find his long-forgotten 
       father who had left him behind. His only clue? He’s a world-famous licensed Hunter -- so Gon sets off to take the 
       notoriously deadly exam and become a Hunter himself. It sounds mundane and almost cheery, but Hunter x Hunter is 
       anything but. The emotional highs and lows and the arcs of both the protagonists and antagonists are some of the best.
        As with most shonen, the dramatic action is fantastic, too.

<p>
      Don’t let the title fool you. Mob Psycho 100 is another fun romp from original One-Punch Man creator One. The series works
       as both a parody of shonen-style anime and a great example of it, revolving around an eighth-grader named Mob, a quiet,
        reserved boy who specializes in exorcising evil spirits. The catch is that his own supernatural powers are tied to his
         emotions. If he gets pushed over the edge, the entire world is in peril. This series thrives on the strength of its humor,
          its small but memorable cast of characters and its dynamic visual style.

<p>
      Also known in the US as Fighting Spirit, Hajime no Ippo is a thrilling adaptation of an incredibly long-running manga series. 
      Picture a mashup of Rocky and The Karate Kid and you’ll have some idea of what to expect from this coming-of-age drama about
       a bullied teen named Ippo Makunouchi who discovers he has a knack for boxing. The series follows Ippo’s training and gradual 
       rise through the boxing ranks. What really makes this series shine is the way it strives to flesh out both sides of any given 
       match-up. Ippo doesn’t just train to be the best, but to understand and connect with his opponents. That alone is enough to
        set this series apart.

      <h1>4. Monster</h1><br>

<p>
      Monster is quite simply one of the best stories ever told in anime/manga form, but more than that, it’s a special anime 
      because of how different it is from everything else. In a medium dominated by giant robots, superpowered heroes that shoot 
      beams out of their hands, and virtual fantasy worlds, Monster is refreshingly grounded in reality. It’s a dark, mature,
       gritty thriller about a good man who loses everything after doing what he believed to be the right thing, and the dark 
       descent that he must endure in order to correct his mistake.

<p>
      After almost 20 years, One Piece continues to entertain audiences worldwide with more than 1000 episodes. Going as long
       as the series has been with its pirate journey, it can be tough for any anime to keep up with fans both new and old. One 
       Piece manages to do that with the amazing mind of Eiichiro Oda. The world building, the deep characters, the hilarious 
       adventure, and the amazing adaptation that sometimes beats out the manga catapults this series to the top of shonen anime 
       history. It’s through Oda’s vision that the series has had such a lasting impact on viewers throughout the years and it 
       doesn’t look to be slowing down any time soon.

<p>
      It’s hard to believe Cowboy Bebop is over 20 years old because of how well it still holds up, both in its conception and 
      its execution. The space western that introduced the world to Spike, Jet, Faye, Ed and of course Ein still looks gorgeous, 
      with a resonant story, strong characters and one heck of a soundtrack that ensures it remains one of the best anime ever made. 
      Cowboy Bebop has had an indelible impact that reaches far beyond anime; everyone from Orson Scott Card to Rian Johnson to
       Robin Williams have praised the series and cited its influence on their work. Cowboy Bebop still works so well because of 
       the continually relatable story at the heart of its genre-bending 26-episode run. Its exploration of adult themes like loss
        anchors the crew’s journey throughout the stars, making it a series we’re happy to revisit even after all this time. Three, 
        two, one, let's jam!

      <img src="C:\Users\fuzzi\Downloads\full-metal-alchemist-brotherhood.webp" height="500px" width="1000px">
<p>
The struggle of most anime is laying out intricate world-building while balancing a cast of memorable characters, iconic moments,
and thrilling fights. And that's what makes Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood so special. The framing device for our entry into 
this sprawling world is one of sympathy. We understand why the Elric brothers would practice forbidden alchemy in an attempt to
 resurrect their dead mother at the cost of their physical bodies. And yet despite divine intervention slapping them in the face, 
 telling them no, they continue on their quest. And that quest to resurrect their mother paves the way for motivation that guides 
 them through a world of monsters, government conspiracy, and divinity. And despite all this elegance, FMA: Brotherhood also knows 
 when to lay it all bare in unforgettable moments that will leave you standing in front of your TV cheering for the Elric brothers.
